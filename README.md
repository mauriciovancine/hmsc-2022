Slides
- [L1 welcome](https://www.helsinki.fi/assets/drupal/2022-08/L1%20welcome.pdf)
- [L2 overview of HMSC](https://www.helsinki.fi/assets/drupal/2022-08/L2%20overview%20of%20HMSC.pdf)

*Break-out groups*

Exercise 1. Apply the Hmsc pipeline to the provided case study data. Define a simplified Hmsc model (no traits, no phylogeny, no random effects), and follow the Hmsc pipeline to generate basic output on parameter estimates. Participants are encouraged to work independently, the teacher is there mainly to help if questions arise.

### Tuesday 16th August 2022

*Plenary sessions*

- R demonstration (by Otso Ovaskainen). Recap of Exercise 1.
- Lecture (by Otso Ovaskainen). The fixed and random effect components of HMSC and their links to ecological theory.
- Lecture (by Sara Taskinen): Using variational approximation for fast estimation of joint species distribution models with various response distributions (note: this lecture is not related to HMSC but to joint species distribution modelling more generally).

Break-out groups

Exercise 2. Continue from Exercise 1 by defining a full HMSC model (with traits, phylogeny, and random effects) and apply the Hmsc pipeline to produce some basic model outputs.

Friday 19th August 2022

Plenary sessions

- R demonstration (by Otso Ovaskainen). Recap of Exercise 4.
- Discussion session (lead by Otso Ovaskainen, Gleb Tikhonov and Jari Oksanen). Recent and future development needs of HMSC: Overview of recently implemented and ongoing developments, and discussion on what users would like to see implemented.
- Discussion session. Based, e.g., on questions that came up during lectures and/or break-out groups that could not have been addressed there.

Break-out groups

In the break-out groups, discussions on topics suggested by the participants, including guidance on working with their own data.
