*Break-out groups*

Exercise 1. Apply the Hmsc pipeline to the provided case study data. Define a simplified Hmsc model (no traits, no phylogeny, no random effects), and follow the Hmsc pipeline to generate basic output on parameter estimates. Participants are encouraged to work independently, the teacher is there mainly to help if questions arise.
