NOTES FOR TODAY

-Update R to avoid errors (4.2.1 is latest version)

-See Otso's email for tips on phylogeny and random effects
-he uses 'tree' to mean sampling unit; your data sampling unit == 'id' (random effect)
-'tree' == tree species (fixed effect; 4 species)

-Depending on system settings, colnames(Y) may not match TrData$species
#can use:
is.equal(colnames(Y),TrData$species) #should be true; if not:   #your files may be named slightly differently, example code only:)
TrData$species <- colnames(Y) 
#row names of TrData need to be species names:
rownames(TrData) <- TrData$species

-see my Excel Hmsc data cheatsheet for formatting questions (will upload to chat)

-to get results from a new model(s) today, move or delete yesterday's material from the 'models' and 'results' folders

-why would you have a random effect of sampling unit (i.e. log or site)? We can discuss as a group


studyDesign = data.frame(site=XData$site, id=XData$id)
# RANDOM EFFECT STRUCTURE, HERE Site (hierarchical study design)
rL.site = HmscRandomLevel(units = levels(studyDesign$site))
